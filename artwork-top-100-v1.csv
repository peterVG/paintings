77,The Massacre at Chios,Eugène Delacroix,1824,"Large Romantic painting showing Greek civilians suffering after an Ottoman massacre, marked by graphic depictions of despair and ruin. Though lacking a heroic focal point (critics were divided), Delacroix’s vivid color and emotional intensity signaled a new direction for history painting, one that emphasized human suffering over heroism. It contributed to Delacroix’s reputation and demonstrated art’s power to galvanize public opinion (supporting the Greek independence cause).",(Unified List Additional: Louvre collection; studied in context of Romanticism and Orientalism)

80,Irises,Vincent van Gogh,1889,"Bright, rhythmic painting of blooming irises created during Van Gogh’s time at the Saint-Rémy asylum. Often called “the painting without blues” (as Van Gogh used violet and green to create harmony), it shows his ability to find beauty and structure in nature amid personal turmoil. Its energetic brushwork and composition (influenced by Japanese ukiyo-e prints) illustrate Van Gogh’s style. It also famously fetched a record price in 1987, underscoring its fame.","TOPofART, Getty Museum archives"

82,The Harvesters,Pieter Bruegel the Elder,1565,"One of the first monumental paintings devoted entirely to peasant life and labor, showing harvesters eating and working in golden late-summer fields. Bruegel’s detailed observation of daily life, combined with a sweeping landscape perspective, was revolutionary. It influenced the course of Western art by validating peasant genre scenes as worthy subjects and remains a Metropolitan Museum of Art star piece.","Scaruffi (as “August” in seasons cycle), Mullins (BBC)"
83,The Dance,Henri Matisse,1910,"Bold, flat depiction of five nudes holding hands in a circle against a simplified landscape of green ground and blue sky.

The Dance is hailed for capturing joy and movement in a radically simplified form, marking a turning point toward abstraction and influencing modernist design.",(Unified List Additional: Highlight in MoMA and Hermitage; widely studied as modern art landmark)
84,The Battle of Alexander at Issus,Albrecht Altdorfer,1529,"Early example of landscape used on a grand scale to dramatize a historical battle (Alexander the Great’s victory), replete with minute figures and a cosmic sky of swirling clouds and twin suns.

Its panoramic detail and vibrant color influenced later epic historical painting and landscape art.","Mullins (BBC), Scaruffi"
85,Venus of Urbino,Titian,1538,"Influential Venetian painting of a reclining nude Venus in a palatial interior, gazing confidently at the viewer. Commissioned as a private piece, its sensual yet candid portrayal set the template for the reclining nude genre (inspiring Manet’s Olympia, etc.). Titian’s mastery of color (soft golden tones) and paint handling in rendering skin and fabrics solidified this work as a prime example of High Renaissance art and a touchstone for debates on the nude in art.","Britannica (Florence list), Art Story (analysis)"

87,Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses),Paul Cézanne,1898–1905,"Monumental Post-Impressionist scene of nude bathers in a landscape, with figures and environment reduced to geometric forms and patches of color. Left somewhat unfinished, it nonetheless greatly impacted 20th-century art; both Matisse and Picasso praised its composition and approach to form. It’s seen as Cézanne’s statement on synthesizing the classical nude tradition with modern abstraction, bridging the old and the new.","Mullins (BBC, as “Bathers”), Philadelphia Museum of Art highlights"

Uccello’s obsessive use of perspective (scattered weapons align to vanishing points) and bold color make it a landmark in the development of perspective in art. Praised by later artists for its quirky, modern feel (the stylized horses and knights), it remains a striking example of Renaissance experimentation.","Scaruffi (Part I listed), Visual-arts-cork (analysis)"
91,"The Bay of Marseille, Seen from l’Estaque",Paul Cézanne,1885,"One of Cézanne’s proto-Cubist landscapes of the view over roofs toward the sea, reducing natural forms to geometric shapes and faceted color planes. This work exemplifies Cézanne’s revolutionary approach of “reconstructing” nature with cylinders, spheres, and cones, greatly influencing Picasso, Braque, and the entire Cubist movement. It’s a bridge between Impressionist light and Cubist form, marking a turning point in art’s path to abstraction.","(Unified List Additional: Commonly cited in Cubism origin discussions, e.g., in MoMA’s Cézanne shows)"

It exemplifies Piero’s exploration of perspective and light (note the reflections in water and play of shadows), and it carries a profound sense of harmony. Esteemed as one of the era’s great religious works, its technique influenced later artists and reinforced Piero’s standing as a master of Quattrocento art.","Scaruffi (as part of Legend of the True Cross), Britannica (Florence list)"

Celebrated in mid-century for its intricate puzzle-like composition, it became one of MoMA’s most popular paintings in the 1940s. Though Tchelitchew’s fame waned, Hide and Seek endures as a cult classic illustrating themes of childhood and fear, and it showcases a unique intricacy that fascinates viewers with its optical illusions and layered imagery.",(Unified List Additional: MoMA’s 1940s icon; appears in discussions of magic realism in painting)
98,"Blue Poles (Number 11, 1952)",Jackson Pollock,1952,"One of Pollock’s later “drip” paintings, distinguished by eight bold dark blue vertical lines (“poles”) amid a complex lattice of dripped and splattered color.

It’s a witty commentary on Dalí’s own persona (“soft” or lacking firmness without the support of his crutches of artifice). While not as famous as his 1930s works, it encapsulates his blend of humor, ego, and the grotesque, showcasing the enduring inventiveness of his post-Persistence imagination.","(Unified List Additional: Not widely cited in major “greatest” lists, included here for diversity from Dalí’s oeuvre given multiple sources already cover his top works)"
